`Alex Akagi's Gift List, in order from easy to hard
- Apples (just like, randomly in passing. also peaches)
- Sushi (really more like sashimi, and also add una-don)
- Teach me something
- Example Change
- Art that I like
- Whiskey (really all alcohol, I generally prefer stronger stuff)
- Substances.
- Spending time with pretty girls (uhhh I really like pretty girls...)
- Introductions to incredible people who you think I have to meet
- Labor (depends on what I'm up to in life, but always looking to hire my talented friends)
- Politicians (gotta get shit moving on a gvt level)
- Professional Orchestra (also, I want to conduct dvorak 9 someday)
- Maintain public infrastructure (shit's starting to fall apart and it would be great if someone just patched it up)
- Automated commutes (automate all driving, humans driving is dangerous!)
- Solutions for living forever (of course this includes staying youthful and also quick death-recovery would be nice)
- Safe & fast interstellar travel (this includes multi-planetary, but Elon is already on it)
- Find a way to get our brains to directly interface with computers (what Elon calls "neural lace")
- Make breakthroughs in human understanding of physics
- Become homies with interstellar beings`,
