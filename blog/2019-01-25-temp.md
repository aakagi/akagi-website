# Hello World!

I'm currently trying to figure out how to use Markdown in React to create a stream of consciousness blog...

This is a test post to see if I can figure out how to convert a .md file into a js string, to then be inserted into my React element.

No clue how it'll go...


...3 hours later

GOT IT!

Had an issue with the md loader because it wasn't working on refresh


# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5

Okay, I'm just gonna reference github's md guide (doing this to style my md)

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


```
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```


lol holy shit I can't believe I just went through and styled all of this stuff...

Indented numbers don't seem to work though, fuck it
