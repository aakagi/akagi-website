`These are the things that I want in life, from easiest to most difficult
- Apples (just like, randomly in passing. also peaches)
- Whiskey (really all good alcohol, I generally prefer stronger stuff)
- Sushi (really more like sashimi, and also unagi)
- Art that I like
- Teach me something useful
- Introductions to incredible people who you think I have to meet
- Working on cool things with my friends
- Well-maintained public infrastructure (shit's starting to fall apart and it would be great if someone just patched it up)
- Automated & fast commutes (automate all driving, humans driving is dangerous!)
- Politicians (gotta get shit moving on a gvt level)
- Professional Orchestra (also, I want to conduct dvorak 9 someday)
- Solutions for living forever (of course this includes staying youthful and also quick death-recovery would be nice)
- Find a way to get our brains to directly interface with computers (what Elon calls "neural lace")
- Make breakthroughs in human understanding of physics
- Safe & fast interstellar travel (this includes multi-planetary, but Elon is already on it)
